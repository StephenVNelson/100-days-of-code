# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Prepped my roommate matching web app to have more security with password digest hashes.

**Thoughts:** I have been working on a web application for a while but it's not in a place where I can share it because it doesn't have enough security to publish. I will be working on doing that so I can share it with you all!

### Day 2: November 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I am set on freeing myself from the monotony of Craigslist posting for my job, so I am writing a ruby program with capybara and selinium-webdriver to automate all of that. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** For work I am supposed to post something on Craigslist three times a day, and for some reason I completely loath it. I have had a hunch for a while that I could maybe do it with Ruby and Capybara since that's what I use for my feature testing, but I haven't moved on it until #100DaysOfCode. Turns out it works great :)

### Day 3: November 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stressed myself the hell out trying to finish my automated Craigslist posting, only to figure out auto posting on FB was WAY harder to figure out. literally could have posted 100 thousand things in that time but somehow this feels better

**Thoughts:** While trying to hack the architecture of FB I am learning a little about React. Apparently with JSX they use this thing called object oriented classes and IDs/ Wut?

### Day 4: November 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Posted ads for available apartments on FB and Craigslist today. Automatically :) I just pressed a button and there it went. I added functionality to have it randomize phrases so it isn't all the same every time. We'll see what works best. I also did a JS exercism.

**Thoughts:** I made some dumb mistakes while I was coding. Like including an empty string in an array where I was sampling my project descriptions etc. I learned about splice, and slice in JS. I am not sure about how regularly I'll use those methods but hey they exist.

### Day 5: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 5: After spending a stupid amount of time circumventing Chrome/FB notifications in Capybara, I added an adorable modal for my roommate match site. I am working on adding enough security so I can post it publicly show you all my progress!

**Thoughts:** It's a bit discouraging how much time a little thing can suck out of your day. I still don't really understand what Capybara::Drive is supposed to mean. I know it has something to do with nested classes or modules, but I'm still not really able to understand the connection in the code. Also, I made a carousel from scratch the other day only to learn that bootstrap comes with easy to setup carousels out of the box. **facepalm**

### Day 6: December 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 6: I've been interested in "Civic Hacking" while living in Chicago. The main ideas are 1) civic improvement thru tech 2) Open-source. Today I created project filtering for @HackForLA. Coming to their site soon! http://hackforla.org

**Thoughts:** CSS takes forever to meddle with! Sometimes I enjoy it, but I mostly hate how long it takes to adjust everything. I also looked into BEM method of class naming/organizing. I like the approach and I think I will utilize it from now on.

### Day 7: December 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 7: Alright, I messed up. I only actually coded for 30 minutes because I spent most my time going through a MERN stack tutorial. But I repented and coded for 2 hours today (Day 8). Forgive me?

**Thoughts:** Going through a tutorial is really slow because I am taking notes while I go. I did learn that NoSQL is often used for big data because it's much faster than relational databases. Now I'm all of the sudden very interested in NoSQL.

### Day 8: December 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 8: I spent stupid amounts of time trying (and succeeding) to justify having an HTML input with a date type rather than 3 different selectors for day/month/year, just so I can take advantage of having pretty date pickers that come with Chrome and Firefox.

**Thoughts:** The complex thing here is that I am accepting strings as the input for what will be date datatypes. So, I have this weird dance of converting strings to Date in the controller before it's sent to the server for further validation. I settled on converting correctly formatted strings to dates, and letting incorrect/empty strings pass by so they can fail the validations. I will continue to work on it tomorrow

### Day 9: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 9: I spent 7 hours relearning stuff I learned about a year and a half ago. (Rails nested attributes, nested forms, etc.) Can you believe it!? I'm putting all this stuff on flashcards so I never have to learn it again.

**Thoughts:** Today feels like a failure. Trodding over the same stuff over again? Bummer. I have been doing flash cards every morning for the past few months to help me remember everything I learn in programming. I hope that will prove to be the remedy for this type of thing.

### Day 10: December 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 10: Sometimes it's a drag to try and push myself to code and other times it's a state of absolute possession. I had to prep an app today for a lesson and went entire too far down a rabbit hole of unobtrusive JavaScript and it was a good time :) #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I still need to proactive my HTTP requests and JavaScript. I can get around for now but I would like to get to a point to where it's totally natural.
