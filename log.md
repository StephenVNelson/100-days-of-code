# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Prepped my roommate matching web app to have more security with password digest hashes.

**Thoughts:** I have been working on a web application for a while but it's not in a place where I can share it because it doesn't have enough security to publish. I will be working on doing that so I can share it with you all!

### Day 2: November 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I am set on freeing myself from the monotony of Craigslist posting for my job, so I am writing a ruby program with capybara and selinium-webdriver to automate all of that. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** For work I am supposed to post something on Craigslist three times a day, and for some reason I completely loath it. I have had a hunch for a while that I could maybe do it with Ruby and Capybara since that's what I use for my feature testing, but I haven't moved on it until #100DaysOfCode. Turns out it works great :)

### Day 3: November 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stressed myself the hell out trying to finish my automated Craigslist posting, only to figure out auto posting on FB was WAY harder to figure out. literally could have posted 100 thousand things in that time but somehow this feels better

**Thoughts:** While trying to hack the architecture of FB I am learning a little about React. Apparently with JSX they use this thing called object oriented classes and IDs/ Wut?

### Day 4: November 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Posted ads for available apartments on FB and Craigslist today. Automatically :) I just pressed a button and there it went. I added functionality to have it randomize phrases so it isn't all the same every time. We'll see what works best. I also did a JS exercism.

**Thoughts:** I made some dumb mistakes while I was coding. Like including an empty string in an array where I was sampling my project descriptions etc. I learned about splice, and slice in JS. I am not sure about how regularly I'll use those methods but hey they exist.

### Day 5: December 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 5: After spending a stupid amount of time circumventing Chrome/FB notifications in Capybara, I added an adorable modal for my roommate match site. I am working on adding enough security so I can post it publicly show you all my progress!

**Thoughts:** It's a bit discouraging how much time a little thing can suck out of your day. I still don't really understand what Capybara::Drive is supposed to mean. I know it has something to do with nested classes or modules, but I'm still not really able to understand the connection in the code. Also, I made a carousel from scratch the other day only to learn that bootstrap comes with easy to setup carousels out of the box. **facepalm**

### Day 6: December 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 6: I've been interested in "Civic Hacking" while living in Chicago. The main ideas are 1) civic improvement thru tech 2) Open-source. Today I created project filtering for @HackForLA. Coming to their site soon! http://hackforla.org

**Thoughts:** CSS takes forever to meddle with! Sometimes I enjoy it, but I mostly hate how long it takes to adjust everything. I also looked into BEM method of class naming/organizing. I like the approach and I think I will utilize it from now on.

### Day 7: December 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 7: Alright, I messed up. I only actually coded for 30 minutes because I spent most my time going through a MERN stack tutorial. But I repented and coded for 2 hours today (Day 8). Forgive me?

**Thoughts:** Going through a tutorial is really slow because I am taking notes while I go. I did learn that NoSQL is often used for big data because it's much faster than relational databases. Now I'm all of the sudden very interested in NoSQL.

### Day 8: December 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 8: I spent stupid amounts of time trying (and succeeding) to justify having an HTML input with a date type rather than 3 different selectors for day/month/year, just so I can take advantage of having pretty date pickers that come with Chrome and Firefox.

**Thoughts:** The complex thing here is that I am accepting strings as the input for what will be date datatypes. So, I have this weird dance of converting strings to Date in the controller before it's sent to the server for further validation. I settled on converting correctly formatted strings to dates, and letting incorrect/empty strings pass by so they can fail the validations. I will continue to work on it tomorrow

### Day 9: December 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 9: I spent 7 hours relearning stuff I learned about a year and a half ago. (Rails nested attributes, nested forms, etc.) Can you believe it!? I'm putting all this stuff on flashcards so I never have to learn it again.

**Thoughts:** Today feels like a failure. Trodding over the same stuff over again? Bummer. I have been doing flash cards every morning for the past few months to help me remember everything I learn in programming. I hope that will prove to be the remedy for this type of thing.

### Day 10: December 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 10: Sometimes it's a drag to try and push myself to code and other times it's a state of absolute possession. I had to prep an app today for a lesson and went entire too far down a rabbit hole of unobtrusive JavaScript and it was a good time :) #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I still need to proactive my HTTP requests and JavaScript. I can get around for now but I would like to get to a point to where it's totally natural.

### Day 11: December 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 11: I have had little to no opportunity to go through code written by others, but thanks to #HackForLA I get to do all kinds of headscratching! I think being able to read code from others will make me a substantially better programmer and I already feel like I'm learning 10x the things I would if I were just learning on my own #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Like I said above, reading code from better this other programmer who clearly has way more experience than me has been really good. I've learned a little about jQuery AJAX calls and how it's way better than just plain JS because it formats everything correctly from the different browsers.

### Day 12: December 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 12: Today is AWESOME and I am JACKED! After googling plenty I now understand 100% of the code written by a fellow programmer at @HackForLA and it's brilliant. I'm V excited to contribute. Also got an idea for a news app that has my heart pumping. Great day. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Today I learned... the second argument in a JQuery function can be html. So the guy I am working with created a template for each project at HackForLA and hid it inside <script> tags and saved that html in a JQuery object and stored it in a variable. He then used that variable as his second argument for a call into a JQuery function then proceeded to change all of the values based on the data!

### Day 14: December 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 14 & 15 & 16: Three days of researching ways to save a JSON file from a github API request to give our Jekyll site "dynamic-ness". I think we've decided on Github actions but it's hella confusing to me. If anybody would like to assists, I wouldn't mind. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 17: December 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 17: The problem solving continues. With some help from @sam I was able to make my first successful Github action! Now I just need to figure out 1) how to save the data as a JSON file and do it all through docker. Progress is slow but inevitable. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 18, 19, 20, 21: December 13, 14, 15, 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 18 & 19 & 20 & 21: Yikes. I have been coding but in misery. Most of my time was spent refactoring my auto-craigslist-poster and do I feel proud? No, just bewildered that it took me so long. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I am just totally spent. I don't feel good at all. I became obsessed with refactoring in the cleanest way possible and it turns out I just wasted a bunch of time because I would start to code in ways that aren't logical/possible so I would have to turn back around and start over again. I think this happened because I wasn't doing TDD. wow. crazy.

### Day 22: December 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 22: Spent my hour adjusting some CSS to fit in a different part of a web page. There are few things as daunting as being handed a massive CSS file and just getting to know the styling one line at a time. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Something I didn't think about but definitely need to implement is going through and deleting classes in the chrome browser so i can see how everything changes.

### Day 23: December 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 23: I gained a stronger testimony about the importance of naming variables in a descriptive way. I got some code from online as a boilerplate and I had to rewrite everything because it was all named a, b, c, d... It's just too many variables! #100DaysOfCode

### Day 24: December 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 24: The amount of effort it takes to change the styling of a select button is straight up comical. I've taken my project to what I deem, the functional eyesore stage. Now accepting all submissions of wisdom on how to improve the aesthetic. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I can't beleive it's day 24. I feel like I have not at all progressed where I want to. I want to have more goal oriented coding time rather than just doing things that feel obligatory.

### Day 25: December 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 25: Why has nobody told me about electron before!? Back when ruby was the only thing I knew I looked all over for a way to create a GUI with ruby code and I always came up with nothing. This makes me excited because there are plenty of personal apps that I would like to have for myself without having to deal with a browser #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** It seems that it is very hard to get the time in that I want for coding. I keep on getting interrupted by so many things, and even then I feel like I am not progressing as fast as I would like.

### Day 26: December 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 26: Second day of learning electron because I finally finished the tutorial videos I was following, only to learn a bit of it was outdated. Was it worth it? Can you work it? Put your thing down, flip it and reverse it? #100DaysOfCode

**[Link to Tweet](https://twitter.com/StephenVNelson/status/1208939590880415744?s=20)**

### Day 27: December 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 27: I want to show my progress in things. I feel like I must be afraid to actually produce and publish code, but if I don't actually write code then I think this #100daysofCode thing isn't going to help me that much. I'll post my code tomorrow.

**[Link to Tweet](https://twitter.com/StephenVNelson/status/1208939673134845953?s=20)**

### Day 28: December 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 28: Big discovery today! You can store html in <template> tags and the browser will totally ignore it, then you can use JS to add that code with your own modifications! I'm using them like little components and its a BLAST #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Today was the most fun I've had in a while coding. I love using electron because I feel like it gives me permission to stop using so many dependancies and make a functional app with the basics... I can't explain why, it just does. aight? I was doing great until I ran into a bit of road block because there is apparently security vulnerabilities with making electron apps the old way by importing modules into the render process. So now there is this weird circuitous way of doing things that is really confusing to me. I hate losing momentum! I just wanna make something!

### Day 29: December 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 29: I like, don't love documentation sometimes. Electron docs say don't turn on node capability for the renderer process for security reasons but then says nothing about how you're supposed to use icp to send signals to the main process. I figured it out eventually... but took me all day. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:**  Coded until I got confused about how to attach a function to an event listener to an object that doesn't exist yet etc. etc.. Functional programming is a slightly different headspace from the object oriented programming I'm used to in ruby but I am really enjoying how versatile it can be.

### Day 30: December 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 30: Just finished a month of #100DaysOfCode and while I've had A LOT of fun the past few days using electron I don't feel like I learned/accomplished as much as I would like. So, I'm making a tasks/goals app to remedy that ;) So far you can just add tasks.

**Thoughts:** Ok, I have really really enjoyed working outside of frameworks. Just me and a lot of javascript, which is so refreshing! It is taking me a little while to figure things out but I feel like I am learning a lot by doing and maintining a great momentum because I don't have to learn norms of different libraries just to code.

### Day 31: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 31: It took 5 hours to add the functionality to automatically post all of my apartments for sale on FB Marketplace (while deleting old posts so I'm not spamming). That's surprisingly fast for me. I feel like I'm getting smarter about finding elements on the DOM. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** A whole day. That's how long it took. Should I feel bad? I don't know. It's something I knew I had to do. I am a little worried. Am I progressing fast enough? Will I be good enough to get a job in the near future? I hope so.

### Day 32: December 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 32: I know have CR*D functionality for my goals app! This has been so fun to develop because it's all composed of javascript that I'm making up off the top of my head. Feels so good to take a break from the constant learning curves of new APIs #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I have a bad habit of coding in my head. It gets to a point where I start to panic a little bit because I can't figure out what I need to code. I need to get in the habit of writing psudocode just to get all of my thoughts out. It's so much less stressful that way.

### Day 33: December 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 33: I finished the update functionality! now I have full CRUD for my goals application. I'm very excited to show everyone but I still have a bit more to do before my big reveal. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** There was a bit of confusion about how I should handle data. I think I may be storing too much of the information in the html of the project. hmmmm.... I think I should rethink how I'm doing it.

### Day 34: December 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 34: I've been researching for a few hours and I hate it! All the good momentum stops because of learning entirely new APIs. I tried to fall asleep after giving up but it was bothering me so much that I woke up and worked on it again. I figured it out!  #100DaysOfCode

### Day 35: December 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Day 35: learned about git rebasing. It basically takes your code that may be behind a certain branch and attaches it to the end of said branch. It's a shorter way around pulling code then pushing it back out again. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** Today I learned a lesson about getting too far ahead of one's self in collaborative projects. Normally I'm working on my own so I can get away with including large swaths of code into a commit and no one is the wiser. But in this case I had to go back, get rid fo some functionality and return my code to a much earlier state in order to keep things in a logical order with the website build.

### Day 36: December 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
* Started building tests for my electron app (my first time using mocha)

**Thoughts:** Day 36: Before I started really getting into these JS projects I read all of You Don't Know Javascript. While I disagree with his sometimes circuitous route to the point, I'm very grateful that I have some real JS literacy! It helps so much in navigating other libraries and APIs. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 37: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Went through Pluralsight course on Promises and async/await
* Duplicated a successful Github action that runs on every push to a repository
* got stumped on running Github actions on a certain schedule
* submitted my second ever stack overflow issue

**Thoughts:** Day 37: I literally did it exactly the way they say to do it in the documentation, and it's still not working. If I change the code to 'on: [push]' it works swimmingly. please help. #githubactions #100DaysOfCode

### Day 38: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Changed Promise based tests to async/await
* Deliberated with myself about how to maintain a test db

**Thoughts:** Day 38: My DB for my electron app is literally just a JSON file. Almost guaranteed to lead to a headache and a new appreciation for SQL/NoSQL. But I'm enjoying running into "building from scratch" problems just be be like "oh! that's why we do it that way!" #100DaysOfCode

### Day 39: January 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked on adding auto-delete FB posts
* Learned about the "select an element in the page to inspect it tool". Comes in real handy while "testing"

**Thoughts:** Day 39: I got to a point to where I was absolutely certain that the code I was writing was correct, and that the computer had grown a mind of its own and was just being obstinate. I'm sure you all know how this story ends. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 41: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Worked on github actions again
* Removed format based on feedback

**Thoughts:** Day 41: I have now successfully made a Github action that will do an API call and update out DB file on a schedule! Now I can say out site is only semi-static! #100DaysOfCode

### Day 42: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Continued research for Github Actions

**Thoughts:** Day 42: Met up with the cats at HackForLA. A guy I talked to who is way smarter than I just got out of a Bootcamp. My goal is to be smarter than every person who just got out of a Bootcamp. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 43: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* laid out possible OLOO redesign of backend code

**Thoughts:** Day 43: Today was mostly daydreaming and writing pseudo-code for a possible redesign of my backend code. #theLifeChangingMagicOfTidyingUp #100DaysOfCode

### Day 44: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Completely redesigned backend code to use OLOO design taught by Kyle Simpson in YDKJS
* Developed entire backend with TDD
* Cleaned up code by just exporting single objects in various modules that are linked to each other
* converted file read/write methods to be async.
* converted tests to be async

**Thoughts:** Day 44: Guys! Today I completely redid my code for my goals app so my CRUD actions use conventions almost identical to Rails apps. I did it using the OLOO design taught by Kyle Simpson. Seriously my code is beautiful and I feel v proud. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 45: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Created a latest method for Tasks

**Thoughts:** Day 45: Writing an app with TDD reminds of filmmaking. The test is the script, the code is the production, and the refactoring is post production. Today I did the equivalent of writing half a scene. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 46: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Read through some documentation for Github actions

**Thoughts:** Day 46: Again, not a lot of time today but I was able to spend some time going through the Github actions documentation. What helps with learning new APIs is rewriting what the docs say in succinct nested bullet points. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 47: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Read through some documentation for Github actions

**Thoughts:** Day 47: Im not sure if anybody else experiences this phenomena, but when I'm learning something new and trying to implement it in my own way on a deadline, I am filled with this strong nervous energy that I have to take frequent breaks to decompress. No matter, I finally created my own Github action! #100DaysOfCode

### Day 49: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Researched React education paths
* Refactored Github action

**Thoughts:** Day 49: I tutor students in programming/web development. Today my student brought me back to the first CS class I ever took at Northwestern. Creating loops boggled my brain so badly I think I was pretty frustrating to the TAs. Now they seems so self evident. I'm appreciating 1) how hard this stuff can be to learn for the first time 2) how far I've come. #100DaysOfCode

### Day 50: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
* Completely restructured Goals app by separating the concerns of Validations from Instances of objects.

**Thoughts:** Day 50: Holy crap. I am halfway done with #100DaysOfCode. To be honest I am disappointed I haven't made a React App yet. So, new goal: Complete a React app before I finish by 100 days are up.
