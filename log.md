# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Prepped my roommate matching web app to have more security with password digest hashes.

**Thoughts:** I have been working on a web application for a while but it's not in a place where I can share it because it doesn't have enough security to publish. I will be working on doing that so I can share it with you all!

### Day 2: November 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I am set on freeing myself from the monotony of Craigslist posting for my job, so I am writing a ruby program with capybara and selinium-webdriver to automate all of that. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** For work I am supposed to post something on Craigslist three times a day, and for some reason I completely loath it. I have had a hunch for a while that I could maybe do it with Ruby and Capybara since that's what I use for my feature testing, but I haven't moved on it until #100DaysOfCode. Turns out it works great :)

### Day 3: November 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stressed myself the hell out trying to finish my automated Craigslist posting, only to figure out auto posting on FB was WAY harder to figure out. literally could have posted 100 thousand things in that time but somehow this feels better

**Thoughts:** While trying to hack the architecture of FB I am learning a little about React. Apparently with JSX they use this thing called object oriented classes and IDs/ Wut?
